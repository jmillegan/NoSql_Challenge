# NoSql_Challenge
Imported dataset with : $ mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json
original import did not include the drop so my Tutor helped me drop it and reload.
Used serveral If Else statement to verify my code worked and was updated.  This helped me tremdously and good practice.
Line 20 in second notebook 'analysis_starter' had to get help from chatgpt on how to add the decimal to the lat and long. 
Got the most help from my tutor on areas of being stuck, my biggest flaw was not originally putting in the 'drop' to my import and had to recreate the dataset
